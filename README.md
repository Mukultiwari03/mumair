# Portfolio Landing Page Replication

This project is a Next.js portfolio landing page replicated from a provided Figma design. It demonstrates my ability to accurately translate a UI design into a fully responsive and functional web page, optimized for performance and SEO.

## Project Overview

This project is a  replication of a portfolio landing page based on a Figma design. It is developed using the Next.js framework, ensuring smooth navigation, responsive design, and optimized performance. The page is broken down into reusable components, each structured for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Features

- Responsive Design: Ensures an optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes.
- Smooth Animations: Implemented using the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for subtle scroll animations.
- Google Fonts Integration: Custom fonts are managed using the [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) package.
- Modular Components: The page is divided into well-structured and reusable components.
- Hosted on Vercel: The live project is hosted on Vercel for easy access.
